This repository was primarily created to build an authentication service. 

The primary objective was to understand what it takes to build an authentication service without the use of any third party frameworks such as PassportJS, Auth0, Cognito, etc.
This helped in understanding the knitty gritty details that is involved in building an authentication service. 

As an initial POC, I have built this token based authentication service using Json Web Tokens. I have used MERN stack as the process to prototype and build with MERN stack is much faster than building it with a more robust framework using other languages such as Go, Java(SpringBoot, DropWizard). I have currently supported only an email-password based authentication.
In future updates, I intend to experiment with social logins, SSOs, etc.
